## Hi!

I'm Cem Dervis. In my day job I work as a software engineer, where I solve various visualization problems.

My main areas of interest in software are low-level optimization techniques, computer graphics and compiler construction.

In computer graphics, I specialize in volumetric rendering.
Languages I use most often include C++, Swift, Rust and C#. Oh, and German, Turkish and English. 🙂

Some of my other interests include hiking, astrophotography, bass guitar and archery.
